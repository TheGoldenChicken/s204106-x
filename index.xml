r\news r\television r\worldnews r\USnews r\qualitynews r\offbeat r\OutOfTheLoop r\Oscars r\boxoffice r\willsmith r\entertainment Next we wanted to download every submission related to the Oscars slap. This was done using the PushshiftAPI from psaw.
We queried for all submissions with one of the follwing words in the title:</description></item><item><title>Network analysis</title><link>https://TheGoldenChicken/s204106-x.github.io/network-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://TheGoldenChicken/s204106-x.github.io/network-analysis/</guid><description>Methods for graph analysis We wanted to analyze how each comment and submission interacts with one another, and the most optimal way, we decided, was to create a graph where the nodes are unique users and the edges their interactions with other comments or submissions. In all cases, these are weighted, but we consider them either directed or undirected. In the undirected case, the weight is simply the sum of replies one user has made to another user&amp;rsquo;s submissions (comments or posts) and vice versa, in the directed case we simply keep track of these two values independently.</description></item><item><title>Text analysis</title><link>https://TheGoldenChicken/s204106-x.github.io/text-analysis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://TheGoldenChicken/s204106-x.github.io/text-analysis/</guid><description>Text analysis To better test our hypothesis of the forums becoming &amp;lsquo;echo chambers&amp;rsquo; for the same opinions, we wanted to look at two things in particular: How much &amp;lsquo;the same things&amp;rsquo; are said across each subreddit, as well as about the discussion in general. We also wanted to analyze the general sentiment of across the subreddits, to see if there was any indication that particularly negative or positive content was being propagated, adding to the &amp;lsquo;echo chamber&amp;rsquo; factor.</description></item></channel></rss>
