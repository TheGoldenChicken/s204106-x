# The Will Smith slap

At the 94th academy awards on march 27, 2022, Will Smith slapped Chris Rock as a reaction to Chris Rock telling a joke about Will Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett. This created an immediate online reaction, particularly on reddit, where many subreddits were abuzz with the news. 

Looking qualitatively at many of the comments and posts, we hypotheized, that a certain, possibly unhealthy discussion was being propagated by the forums, with some subreddits being heavily biased towards either one side or the other, particularly in regards to Reddit's (partial) role as a place for discusison. Instead of discussion, this could potentially create a sort of 'echo chamber' effect, where instead of people meeting to exchange different views, instead propagate only one viewpoint and simply reinforce this for each other.

This 'echo chamber' effect especially is interesting, as it has been seen on sites before such as QAnon to have potentially devastating effects in situations such as the storming of the capitol building in the US.

In this report, we analyze data collected from Reddit in the days following the slap, and use methods to discern whether or not there is the proposed 'echo chamber' effect, and whether or not the viewpoints propagated on the sites are wholly of one sentiment or another. We present our methods for scraping, cleaning and preparing the data for use, as well our methods for detecting the syntactic content of the comments, as well as the sentiment. 

Furthermore, we conclude, that while it may seem qualitatively so, that the echo chamber effect is quite real, we find no hard evidence to support this. Some results such as the modularlity of the graphs created seem to suggest some trends of 'echo chambering', but without a baseline with regards to those same subreddits before the Will Smith slap, we cannot conclude anything meaningful.

Finally, we motivate the continuation of studies about this subject, particularly to obtain meaningful baselines for the subreddits examined, as without prior knowledge about the general behavior of users on these subreddits, it is difficult to say if any one finding is atypical to the Will Smith slap in particular.
